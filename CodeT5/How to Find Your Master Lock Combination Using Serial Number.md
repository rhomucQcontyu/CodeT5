In this article, we will explain how to find your lock's serial number, how to fill out and submit the Lost Combination Form, and what to expect after you send your request. By following these steps, you will be able to unlock your Master Lock and access your belongings.
  
## Step 1: Find Your Lock's Serial Number
 
The first step to finding your Master Lock combination using serial number is to locate your lock's serial number. The serial number is usually stamped on the back of the lock body or on the bottom of the lock case. It consists of a letter followed by six numbers, for example, A123456.
 
If you cannot find your serial number on your lock, you can also check the original packaging or the instruction sheet that came with your lock. If you still cannot find it, you might have to contact Master Lock customer service for assistance.
  
## Step 2: Fill Out and Notarize the Lost Combination Form
 
The next step is to fill out the Lost Combination Form (PDF) that you can download from Master Lock's website. You will need to provide your name, address, phone number, email address, lock model number, and serial number. You will also need to sign and date the form.
 
However, filling out the form is not enough. You also need to have it notarized by a Notary Public to prove that you are the owner of the lock. A Notary Public is a person who is authorized to witness and verify signatures on legal documents. You can find a Notary Public at banks, post offices, libraries, or online services.
 
You can include up to six combinations on one notarized form. If you have more than six locks that you need combinations for, you will need to fill out and notarize additional forms.
  
## Step 3: Submit Your Form to Master Lock
 
The final step is to submit your notarized form to Master Lock. You can either mail it or fax it to the following address:
 
Master Lock Warehouse
 24 North Free Port Drive
 Nogales, AZ 85621
 Fax: 800-308-9245
 
You will also need to pay a $10 fee per lock for processing your request. You can pay by check or money order made payable to Master Lock Company LLC. Do not send cash or credit card information.
  
## What Happens Next?
 
After you submit your form and payment, you will have to wait for Master Lock to process your request and send you your combination. This can take up to four to six weeks depending on the volume of requests they receive.
 
You will receive your combination by email if you provided an email address on your form. Otherwise, you will receive it by mail. Make sure to check your spam folder if you do not see it in your inbox.
 
Once you receive your combination, you can use it to unlock your Master Lock and access your belongings. You can also write down your combination and store it in a safe place for future reference.
  
## Conclusion
 
Finding your Master Lock combination using serial number is possible if you follow these three steps: find your lock's serial number, fill out and notarize the Lost Combination Form, and submit it to Master Lock with a $10 fee per lock.
 
By doing so, you will be able to retrieve your combination within four to six weeks and unlock your Master Lock without having to buy a new one.
