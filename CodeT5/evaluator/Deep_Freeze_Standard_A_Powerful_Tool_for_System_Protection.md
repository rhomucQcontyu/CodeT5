How does Deep Freeze Standard work? It is very simple and easy to use. After you install the software, you can choose which drives or partitions you want to freeze. You can also set a password to protect the software settings and prevent unauthorized changes. Once you have configured the software, you can enable or disable the freezing mode with a simple keyboard shortcut or a click of a mouse.
 
When the freezing mode is enabled, any changes made to the frozen drives or partitions will be temporary and will not affect the original system configuration. You can install new software, update existing programs, modify system settings, browse the internet, download files, or do anything else you want on your computer. However, as soon as you restart your computer, all the changes will be gone and your system will return to the state it was in before you enabled the freezing mode.
 
When the freezing mode is disabled, any changes made to the frozen drives or partitions will be permanent and will affect the original system configuration. You can use this mode when you want to make some changes that you want to keep, such as installing security patches, updating drivers, or adding new hardware. However, you should be careful when using this mode, as any mistakes or problems that occur in this mode will not be reversible.
