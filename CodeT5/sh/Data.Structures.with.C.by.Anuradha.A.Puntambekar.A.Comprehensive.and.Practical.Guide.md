The book covers both the concepts and implementation of various data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, hashing and file structures. It also discusses the algorithm complexity and time-space trade-off of different operations on data structures. The book uses a systematic approach wherein each data structure is explained using examples followed by its implementation using C programming. The book also provides numerous exercises, solved examples and model question papers for practice and revision.
 
Data Structures with C is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of computer science and engineering, as well as professionals who want to learn or refresh their knowledge of data structures using C programming. The book assumes that the readers have some basic knowledge of C programming and elementary mathematics. The book is well-organized, clear and concise, and uses illustrative diagrams and tables to enhance the understanding of the subject.
 
The book can be purchased online from various websites such as Amazon.com, Barnes&Noble.com, Books-A-Million.com and IndieBound.com. Alternatively, it can be borrowed from a library that has a copy of the book. The book has received positive reviews from readers who have found it useful and informative.
  
Some of the topics covered in the book are:
 
- Arrays: The book explains the definition, representation and analysis of single and multidimensional arrays, as well as their applications and operations. It also covers character strings in C, array as parameters, ordered lists and sparse matrices and vectors.
- Stacks: The book describes the array and linked representation and implementation of stacks, as well as the operations on stacks such as push and pop. It also shows how to use stacks for converting and evaluating infix, prefix and postfix expressions.
- Recursion: The book introduces the concept of recursion, recursive definition and processes, and recursion in C. It also gives examples of recursion, such as the Tower of Hanoi problem, simulating recursion, backtracking and recursive algorithms. It also discusses the principles of recursion, tail recursion and removal of recursion.
- Queues: The book illustrates the array and linked representation and implementation of queues, as well as the operations on queues such as create, add, delete, full and empty. It also covers circular queues, D-queues and priority queues.
- Linked Lists: The book demonstrates the representation and implementation of singly linked lists, two-way header list, traversing and searching of linked list, overflow and underflow, insertion and deletion to/from linked lists. It also explains doubly linked list, linked list in array, polynomial representation and addition, generalized linked list, garbage collection and compaction.

The book has been praised by readers for its comprehensive and consistent coverage of both the concepts and implementation of data structures using C programming. The book has been rated 4.5 out of 5 stars on Goodreads.com[^3^], a popular website for book reviews. Some of the comments from the readers are:

> "This book is very helpful for understanding data structures using C. The examples are clear and easy to follow. The exercises are challenging and useful for practice."

> "I liked this book because it covers all the topics in detail and with diagrams. The language is simple and understandable. The book is well-organized and has a good flow."

> "This is one of the best books on data structures using C. The author has explained everything very well with examples and logic. The book is also updated with the latest version of C programming."
