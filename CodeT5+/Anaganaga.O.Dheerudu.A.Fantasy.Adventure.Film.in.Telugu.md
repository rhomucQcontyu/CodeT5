The film was released on January 14, 2011, coinciding with the Sankranthi festival. The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, who praised the visual effects, music and performances, but criticized the weak story, slow pace and lack of originality. The film was also compared unfavorably to Hollywood films like The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings. The film was rated PG-13 by the MPAA for violence and scary images. [^1^]
 
The film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures with a budget of â¹26 crore (US$3.6 million), making it one of the most expensive Telugu films at that time. The film was also the first Telugu film to be co-produced by Disney. The film was shot extensively in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The film used advanced visual effects and animation, which were done by Firefly Creative Studio, Prasad EFX and Pixelloid Studios. The film also featured a special song by pop singer Sunitha Sarathy.

The film was a commercial failure at the box office, failing to recover its production costs. The film grossed only â¹10 crore (US$1.4 million) in its lifetime run, making it one of the biggest flops of 2011. The film was also a flop in its dubbed versions in Tamil and Malayalam. The film's poor performance was attributed to its high budget, low publicity, lack of star power and stiff competition from other Sankranthi releases like Mirapakay, Parama Veera Chakra and Siruthai.
